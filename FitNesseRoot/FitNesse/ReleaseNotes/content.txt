 * Added &debug flag to TestResponder url.  This forces the test to run ''inside'' the fitnesse process.  If you are running fitnesse in a debugger, you can breakpoint your fixtures.
 * Symbols can be java properties or environment variables.  Symbols first, env variables second, java properties third.
 * If the first cell of a script table is a symbol assignment ($V=) then the rest must be a function call.  The symbol is assigned the return value of the function.
